SBI PO / Banking Exam Enhancement Roadmap
To transform QuantFlow into the ultimate SBI PO proficiency tool, we must move beyond pure arithmetic into "Exam-Specific Patterns".

1. Approximation & Simplification (High Priority)
Banking exams usually have 5-10 questions on Simplification/Approximation where exact calculation isn't needed, but smart estimating is.

New Category: approximation
Logic: Questions like 12.05% of 199.99 + 44.9% of 401 = ?
Variants: bodmas_rules, nearest_integer, root_approx

2. Quadratic Equation "Sign Method" Drills
The "Quadratic Inequality" section (5 questions) is often solved in seconds using sign reversal tricks without solving the full equation.

New Category: quadratics
Logic: Present x² - 7x + 12 = 0 and y² + 5y + 6 = 0.
User Action: Instead of finding roots, user quickly taps relationship: x > y, x < y, x ≥ y, etc.
Focus: Speed recognition of +,+ roots vs -,+ roots.
3. Data Interpretation (DI) Speed Drills
DI is the heart of SBI PO. We can't render full charts, but we can isolate the calculation component:

New Category: di_calc
Variants:
average_increase: "(A+B+C)/3 vs (D+E+F)/3 diff?"
ratio_aggregation: "Sum of A:B:C is 5400, whats A+C?"
percent_more_less: "1450 is what % more than 1200?"
4. Number Series Pattern Recognition
Missing number or wrong number series are pattern-based.

New Category: number_series
Logic: Generate sequence 2, 5, 11, 23, ? (Logic: x2 + 1)
User Action: Type the next number.
Recommended Phase 1: Approximation
Approximation is the easiest "quick win" that feels distinctly like a banking exam tool rather than a generic math trainer.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

Choose one direction to start. Approximation fits the current UI best. Quadratics requires new UI buttons (>, <, =, etc.). Number Series needs a wider display.
